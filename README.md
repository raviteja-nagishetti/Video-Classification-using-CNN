•	Extracting frames from videos

•	Classifyig each frame using CNN

•	Construct model using ResNet50

•	Fine Tuning

•	Perform Rolling Prediction

# CNN for Image Classification

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) leverage spatial information, and they are therefore well suited for classifying images. These networks use an ad hoc architecture inspired by biological data taken from physiological experiments performed on the visual cortex. Our vision is based on multiple cortex levels, each one recognizing more and more structured information. First, we see single pixels, then from that we recognize simple geometric forms, and more sophisticated elements such as objects, faces, human bodies, animals, and so on.

# Building the model using ResNet 50
	
ResNet-50 is a pretrained Deep Learning model for image classification of the Convolutional Neural Network(CNN, or ConvNet), which is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. ResNet-50 is 50 layers deep and is trained on a million images of 1000 categories from the ImageNet database. Furthermore the model has over 23 million trainable parameters, which indicates a deep architecture that makes it better for image recognition. Using a pretrained model is a highly effective approach, compared if you need to build it from scratch, where you need to collect great amounts of data and train it yourself. Of course, there are other pretrained deep models to use such as AlexNet, GoogleNet or VGG19, but the ResNet-50 is noted for excellent generalization performance with fewer error rates on recognition tasks and is therefore a useful tool to know.
